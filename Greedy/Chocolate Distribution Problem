Steps:
1. sort the chocolate packets
2. Use sliding window protocol to find the minimum difference in all windows of size M 

class Solution{
    public:
    long long findMinDiff(vector<long long> a, long long n, long long m){
    //code
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    
    long long j = 0;
    
    long long diff = INT_MAX;
    
    for(long long i = m-1; i < a.size(); i++){
        diff = min(a[i] - a[j], diff);
        j++;
    }
    
    return diff;
    
    
    }
